    <h1><strong>Welcome!</strong></h1>
    <p>Individual, stylish, and central – that's our Domus Merian XII, our spacious holiday apartment in the heart of Trier. City explorers and families with children alike will find a cozy and well-equipped home away from home that radiates a very special charm. We travel a lot ourselves and are always on the lookout for unique accommodations that stay with us long after the trip ends. That's why we designed our home in Trier just the way we would like it – with a clever mix of old and new, different patterns, and rich colors. From the first to the last second, you'll feel completely at ease here!</p>

    <h1><strong>Well taken care of</strong></h1>
    <p>No matter whether you arrive during the day or late at night – a little something to eat is always available. In the kitchen, you'll find small bites to enjoy at your leisure. In the bathroom, you'll find a variety of hygiene items, and in your bedroom, a fluffy soft bed is already waiting for you.</p>

    <h1><strong>Explore and discover</strong></h1>
    <p>Just as unique as the decor is the location of our Domus Merian XII. You're just a ten-minute walk from the Porta Nigra, Trier’s most famous landmark – and it's also just a short stroll to the theater, the Rhineland State Museum, and the cathedral. So you can confidently leave your car in our private garage during your stay. Even if you plan a day trip to Luxembourg, you won’t need it – the train will get you right into the action in under an hour.</p>

    <h2><strong>We wish you a wonderful and varied stay!<br>
    Your hosts,<br>
    Jana and Marion Thill :)</strong></h2>
